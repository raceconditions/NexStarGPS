## Introduction

This Android application will sync GPS coordinates as well as the current system date and time with a NexStar telescope via TCP socket.  This application requires that a networked socket is avaliable and connected to a NexStar telescope via RS-232 serial.

## Features

* Connects to a remote TCP server
* Sends GPS coordinates to remote telescope
* Sends current date and time to remote telescope

## Planned Features

* Connects directly to a local telescope via USB -> RS-232 serial
